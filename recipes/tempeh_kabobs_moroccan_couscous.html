        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place tempeh, mushrooms, eggplant, red bell pepper, and cherry tomatoes in a large resealable plastic bag. In a mixing bowl, whisk together olive oil, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and honey; season with 1 tablespoon ginger, 1 tablespoon garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour mixture over tempeh and veggies, seal, and shake to coat. Refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium-high heat. Thread tempeh and veggies on skewers. Reserve remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Grill skewers, turning often to make sure everything is cooked evenly. These can also be done in the broiler.</li>
            <li>While grilling kabobs, combine vegetable stock, 1 tablespoon grated ginger, cumin, and salt. Bring to a light boil. Stir in couscous, raisins, and garbanzo beans; cover, and remove from heat. Let sit for five minutes, or until fluffy. Just before serving, squeeze lemon over couscous and stir. Serve kabobs with reserved marinade.</li>
